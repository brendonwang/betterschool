    <i>Chapter 2:</i><br><br>
    When you eat starch and other carbohydrates, your digestive system breaks them down into glucose. Glucose then moves
    into your blood, and your circulatory system carries it through your body.
    The pancreas is part of the digestive system and makes lots of digestive enzymes. These enzymes help break down food
    into smaller molecules, like glucose and amino acids, that are tiny enough to pass from the digestive system into
    the circulatory system
    Asthma affects more than just your breathing. When you breathe in, you pull oxygen molecules from the air into your
    respiratory system. In your respiratory system, oxygen moves through smaller and smaller tubes deep into your
    lungs.<br><br>

    <i>Chapter 1:</i><br><br>
    Your blood includes thirteen different protein molecules called clotting factors. When you injure yourself, these
    clotting factor proteins all connect and work together to form a solid clot. If you were missing even one of those
    thirteen proteins, the clot wouldn’t form.
    People with hemophilia are missing one of the proteins needed for blood clotting.
    People with hemophilia are missing clotting factor proteins because of a problem with their genes. Different genes
    carry instructions for making different proteins.<br><br>
    <i>Chapter 2:</i><br><br>
    We inherit our genes from our biological parents through the process of sexual reproduction. Each parent has a
    complete set of genes. These genes are organized on matching pairs of chromosomes and each has two copies of each
    gene.
    If a parent has two different versions of the gene, some of the reproductive cells will end up with one version,
    while other reproductive cells will end up with the other version.<br><br>

    <i>Chapter 1:</i><br><br>
    An air conditioner uses machines and chemicals to remove kinetic energy from the molecules that make up the air
    inside a room. This slows the molecules down and lowers the room’s air temperature.
    When you use an air conditioner, you’re making it hotter outside by transferring energy from the air inside a
    building to the air outside the building. The air inside and the air outside are two parts of one system, connected
    by the air conditioner.
    Whether you are cooling a room or your forehead, you need to transfer energy to do it. When one thing cools down,
    something else has to warm up. Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, a change in temperature always means
    energy has been transferred—it always comes from somewhere and goes somewhere else.
