Living things, such as plants, animals, and bacteria
Microorganisms are so small they cannot be seen with the naked eye.<br><br>

"Food poisoning" is usually caused by bacteria, including Salmonella, a type of bacteria commonly found in chickens and other animals.
If there are no beneficial bacteria in the gut, the Salmonella population can grow and take over, causing food poisoning.
Salmonella causes vomiting, diarrhea, and intestinal pain for up to a week. Most people get better without treatment from a doctor, but in some cases, Salmonella can leave the intestines and move into the blood.<br><br>

<i>Chapter 1:</i><br><br>
We need to breathe in oxygen molecules from the air around us to keep our bodies alive. Our bodies need other important molecules, such as amino acids and glucose, from the food we eat.
Amino acid molecules are the building blocks of proteins, and we get them from protein-rich foods like beans, meat, and eggs.
We get glucose molecules mainly by breaking down foods that contain starch, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains.<br><br>
