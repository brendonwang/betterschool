    <i>Chapter 1:</i><br><br>
    An air conditioner uses machines and chemicals to remove kinetic energy from the molecules that make up the air
    inside a room. This slows the molecules down and lowers the room’s air temperature.
    When you use an air conditioner, you’re making it hotter outside by transferring energy from the air inside a
    building to the air outside the building. The air inside and the air outside are two parts of one system, connected
    by the air conditioner.
    Whether you are cooling a room or your forehead, you need to transfer energy to do it. When one thing cools down,
    something else has to warm up. Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, a change in temperature always means
    energy has been transferred—it always comes from somewhere and goes somewhere else.
