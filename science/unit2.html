    <i>Chapter 1:</i><br /><br />
    We need to breathe in oxygen molecules from the air around us to keep our
    bodies alive. Our bodies need other important molecules, such as amino
    acids and glucose, from the food we eat. Amino acid molecules are the
    building blocks of proteins, and we get them from protein-rich foods like
    beans, meat, and eggs. We get glucose molecules mainly by breaking down
    foods that contain starch, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains.<br /><br />
    <i>Chapter 2:</i><br /><br />
    When you eat starch and other carbohydrates, your digestive system breaks
    them down into glucose. Glucose then moves into your blood, and your
    circulatory system carries it through your body. The pancreas is part of
    the digestive system and makes lots of digestive enzymes. These enzymes
    help break down food into smaller molecules, like glucose and amino acids,
    that are tiny enough to pass from the digestive system into the
    circulatory system Asthma affects more than just your breathing. When you
    breathe in, you pull oxygen molecules from the air into your respiratory
    system. In your respiratory system, oxygen moves through smaller and
    smaller tubes deep into your lungs.<br /><br />
