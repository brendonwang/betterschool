    <i>Chapter 1:</i><br><br>
    Your blood includes thirteen different protein molecules called clotting factors. When you injure yourself, these
    clotting factor proteins all connect and work together to form a solid clot. If you were missing even one of those
    thirteen proteins, the clot wouldnâ€™t form.
    People with hemophilia are missing one of the proteins needed for blood clotting.
    People with hemophilia are missing clotting factor proteins because of a problem with their genes. Different genes
    carry instructions for making different proteins.<br><br>
    <i>Chapter 2:</i><br><br>
    We inherit our genes from our biological parents through the process of sexual reproduction. Each parent has a
    complete set of genes. These genes are organized on matching pairs of chromosomes and each has two copies of each
    gene.If a parent has two different versions of the gene, some of the reproductive cells will end up with one version,
    while other reproductive cells will end up with the other version.<br><br>
