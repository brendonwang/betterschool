      <b>The Law of Linear Equations is y=mx+b, where y and x are coordinates, the amount of x and b is just a number,</b> <br><br>
      Take this problem as an example, <br>
      <code>4x=-y+7; 3=7x-y</code><br><br>
      <i>Find x and y</i><br><br>

Make sure y is on the left of the equal sign and that the mx is in front of b in both equations, then, make sure that y is positive, if it is negative, make it positive and make every positive, negative and vice versa (be careful to multiply anything that has changed sides by -1) 

Y=4x+7; y=7x-3 

Now that we have a much nicer set of equations, we take the equations on the right side of the equal sign and shove them into this 

Mx+b=Mx+b 

Which in this case is: 

4x+7=7x-3 

Now, we separate the variables from the equation 

-3x+7=-3 

Since 4x-7x = 3x, we can just replace 4x with 3x and erase 7x, now we move the 7 to the other side which makes  

-3x=-10 

Now we make x positive which in turn makes -10 positive as well 

3x=10 

Now, divide both sides by 3 

X=10/3 

Now, we use one of the 2 equations for y, you can choose either one 

Y=4x+7 

Or  

Y=40/3 + 7/1=40/3 + 21/3=61/3=20 1/3=20 and one-third 

X=3 1/3 

Y=20 1/3
