    There are 6 functions, the One-to-One Function, the Identity Function, the Linear Function, Reciprocal of a Function, the Quadratic Function, and the Power Function. <br><br>

 

The One-to-One Functions only exist when you can draw horizontal lines across the coordinate plane and only have intersected one point of the graph. The Reciprocal Function is a The One-to-One Function itself. The One-to-One Functions are injective which means that only one value of x can be paired with a unique y. <br><br>

 

The Identity Function is a function that always gives you the same value of the value you imputed, when graphed it will always be a 45-degree diagonal line that intersects the origin or <code>(0,0)</code>. <br><br>

 

Linear functions are those where variable x never has an exponent larger than 1. So, they would not have a variable such as 3x2 in them. The linear function on this page is the general way we write the equation of a straight line. The variable is the slope of the line and controls its “steepness”.<br><br> 

The Quadratic Function comes from the word square as the variable, preferably ax gets squared, a, being the amount of x and x being the variable, the equations usually look like this ax^2 + bx + c = y. a, b and c are known values and a cannot be 0, if a is 0, the equation is not quadratic. <br><br>

Power function is a one-term function with a variable as the base and a constant as the exponent. The exponent in the case of a power function is always a constant and a real number. <br><br>

The general form of a power function is, <br>

\(f(x)=kxnf(x)=kxn\)<br>

Some common power functions are as follows: <br><br>

Area of a square =\(s^2\)<br>

Area of a circle =\(πr^2\)<br>

Volume of a sphere = \(\frac{4πr^3}{3}\)<br><br> 

Area of a pentagon =\(\frac{(\sqrt(5+2\sqrt(5)))s^2}{4}\)<br><br>

The purpose of a power function is to return a number raised to a power. That it calculates the power of the variable.
