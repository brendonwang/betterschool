      Living things, such as plants, animals, and bacteria
      Microorganisms are so small they cannot be seen with the naked eye.<br><br>
  <i>Chapter 2:</i><br><br>
      "Food poisoning" is usually caused by bacteria, including Salmonella, a type of bacteria commonly found in chickens and other animals.
      If there are no beneficial bacteria in the gut, the Salmonella population can grow and take over, causing food poisoning.
      Salmonella causes vomiting, diarrhea, and intestinal pain for up to a week. Most people get better without treatment from a doctor, but in some cases, Salmonella can leave the intestines and move into the blood.<br><br>
